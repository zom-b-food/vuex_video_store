# vuex_video_store

I approached this project as a user story and it's several tasks with the estimated time expectation of 3 hours. And since I received this error: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists , performing git clone to the starter templates was not possible so I built what you see here from scratch. I confess to going over the time expectation by 1 hour as I'm much more familiar with Angular than I am with VUEX/NUXT. In any event, I'm confident all tasks could be completed and a few kinks ironed out given another hour or so.

Evidence of all other required skills can be viewed in my development sandbox at http://uiuxsandbox.com and many other of my URLs listed on my cover letter.

Thank you,
